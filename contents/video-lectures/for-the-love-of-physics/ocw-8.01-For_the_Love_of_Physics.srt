1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,050

2
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,190
WALTER LEWIN: Take your seats.

3
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,460
Take your seats, please.

4
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:11,950

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,740
My lecture will be
about 40 minutes.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,440
And after that, I will give
anyone the opportunity to ask

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,650
me questions for about
15 or 20 minutes.

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,420
So the whole thing
will be one hour.

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,895
And it is after that hour that
we will do book signing.

10
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:29,400
You can buy the books there
if you want to and

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,120
I'll sign them here.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,370
We'll get back to that later.

13
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,390

14
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,280
If you have a pendulum--

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,150

16
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:47,590
this is a pendulum,
mass m, length l--

17
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,720
that you can derive, which I do
in class, but I won't bore

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,150
you with that.

19
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,580
You can derive how long it takes
for the pendulum to make

20
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,120
one complete oscillation.

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,225
And we call that the period
of the pendulum.

22
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:09,460
And I'd arrive in class that
that period equals 2 pi times

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,480
the square root of L over g.

24
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,570
You already know what L is.

25
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,470
If you don't know what
pi is, you might as

26
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,870
well leave right now.

27
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,990
And g is what we call the
gravitational acceleration,

28
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,120
which is approximately the
same everywhere on Earth.

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:36,170
But it is very close in
Boston to 9.80 meters

30
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,930
per second per second.

31
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,940
And you will say, well, that's
meters per second per second.

32
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,530
What that means is that if you
have an object and you drop it

33
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,340
from a very large altitude,
very high--

34
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,280
a few hundred meters high--

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,490
and I dropped it 0 speed.

36
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,130
After one second, it will
have a speed of

37
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,380
9.8 meters per second.

38
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,810
But after another second, it
will add to that 9.8 meters

39
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,330
per second.

40
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,680
So it's twice that.

41
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,060
And after three seconds,
it's 3 seconds.

42
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,639
So now you understand
why it is meters

43
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,130
per second per second.

44
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,660
And so that's the
meaning of g.

45
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,720

46
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,240
There is something weird about
this equation, something that

47
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,710
must go against your
intuition.

48
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,420
And you shouldn't feel bad
because it also goes against

49
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,110
my intuition.

50
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,480
So we have the pendulum, and
suppose I bring the pendulum

51
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,360
all the way out here.

52
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,690
We call that the amplitude
of the pendulum.

53
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,940
And we let is swing
back and forth.

54
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,900
There's a certain period.

55
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,180
But now, we bring it
out only this far.

56
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,470
It doesn't have to travel
very much at all.

57
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,250
Doesn't that make a difference
in the periods?

58
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,690
The equation says
no, it doesn't.

59
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,300
Because if it did make a
difference, there would be in

60
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,690
that equation the amplitude,
which is not.

61
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,640
And I'm going to demonstrate
that to you, that it is quite

62
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,280
remarkable that indeed that
period is independent of

63
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,430
amplitude if you don't
go to extreme

64
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,190
values of the amplitude.

65
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,860
There is something else in
here, which is even more

66
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,640
non-intuitive.

67
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,740
And that is doesn't it matter
whether the bob--

68
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,000
we call this the bob--

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,300
whether it is 1 kilogram
or 500 kilograms?

70
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,440
You would think, well,
that must make a

71
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,600
difference in the period.

72
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,860
But the equation says
sorry, it doesn't.

73
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,760
And I'm going to demonstrate
that to you, too.

74
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,110
We have here--

75
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,420
by the way, if you ever want
to test this pendulum, this

76
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,880
equation for yourself, put
in L equals 1 meter

77
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,080
and use this number.

78
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,685
You will get a period
of 2.0 seconds.

79
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:57,660
It's very easy to do at home.

80
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,950
You make one meter.

81
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,860
You put an apple at the bottom
and you swing it.

82
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,420
The one meter has
to be accurate.

83
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,310
You see that it's going
to be 2.0 seconds.

84
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:13,270
Our pendulum that we have
here is really the

85
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,660
mother of all pendulums.

86
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,279
Look at it.

87
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:25,390
15 and 1/2 kilograms and the
length of this pendulum is

88
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,490
5.21 meters.

89
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:36,620
However, you must understand
that it is very difficult to

90
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,380
measure that to very
high accuracy.

91
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,530
And so there is an uncertainty
in the measurement of the

92
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,600
lengths that we have to be
honest about because we are

93
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,550
physicists, after all.

94
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,780
And the uncertainty we
estimate is about 5

95
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,770
centimeters.

96
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,930
So we could be off
by 5 centimeters.

97
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:04,520
That means that is 1%, 5
centimeters is 1% out of 521.

98
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,000
But since L only shows up as the
square root, it means the

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,660
uncertainty in the time
that we predict

100
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,330
is only half a percent.

101
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,200
And if you don't see the reason
why the 1% becomes half

102
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,660
a percent, that's OK, then
just forget about it.

103
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,530
You take my word for it.

104
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,580
So now, I can make
a prediction.

105
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,830
So I predict using
this equation--

106
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,060
that's all I do.

107
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,480
I put in 5.21.

108
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,330
I put in 9.80.

109
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,240
I multiply by 2 pi, and I make
the prediction that the period

110
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:51,550
of that pendulum is 4.58 plus
or minus 0.02 seconds.

111
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,790
Why the plus or minus 0.02?

112
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,220
Well, that is the half a percent
uncertainty due to the

113
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,370
square root of L. You can
immediately see that 2 is

114
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,200
about half percent of 458.

115
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,660
So my prediction can be
no better than that.

116
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,560

117
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,580
Now comes the problem.

118
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,580
I have to measure the period
to convince you that it is

119
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,410
independent of amplitude and
to convince you that it is

120
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,670
independent of mass.

121
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,710
So the biggest problem now is
Walter Lewin himself, which is

122
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,490
my reaction time.

123
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,000
How accurately am I able to
make that measurement?

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,610
That has nothing to do with our
lack of knowledge of the

125
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,000
exact length.

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,990
Now, the last time that I gave
this lecture with the pendulum

127
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,990
is 12 years ago.

128
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,240
I was 63.

129
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,670
And at that time, I told the
class my reaction time is a

130
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,280
tenth of a second.

131
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,540
And it was.

132
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,630
But now, I'm 75.

133
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:06,230
And so my reaction time is
no longer 0.1 seconds.

134
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,320
What is it?

135
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,900
Well, I do not know.

136
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,200
But I have a feeling that if you
want to be kind to me for

137
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:20,430
a change, let us assume that my
reaction time at age 75 is

138
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,450
now 2/10 of a second.

139
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,750
So if you can live with that,
then every measurement that I

140
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,770
make, no matter how long
it is, it is uncertain

141
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,590
to 2/10 of a second.

142
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,140
Do not confuse that
with that 0.02.

143
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,240
That has to do with
the length.

144
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,310
All right.

145
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:47,240
So I'm going to first make
a period measurement at 5

146
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,710
degrees, and then at 10
degrees amplitude.

147
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,550
And I'm going to measure
10 periods, not 1.

148
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,170
Some of you may think, well,
isn't that a waste of time to

149
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,290
do 10 periods if you can
get away with 1?

150
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:07,010
You will very quickly
see why it is 10.

151
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,910
You will see that .

152
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:15,080
So the 10T is then going to be
some number plus or minus my

153
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,370
own inability, which is my 0.2
seconds reaction time.

154
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,410
I can't change that.

155
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,710
And so then I do
the 10 degrees.

156
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,774
And then we get again, 10T.

157
00:08:25,774 --> 00:08:27,650
We get a number.

158
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,650
And then we get again, plus
or minus 0.2 seconds.

159
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,780
And I'm going to demonstrate
to you that within the

160
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,789
uncertainty of the measurements,
that I get the

161
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:42,559
same numbers in all three cases,
within the uncertainty.

162
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,180
So if you're ready for that,
you see here the timer.

163
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,290
All of your can see.

164
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,600
And here you see the pendulum.

165
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,880
And I have two marks
on the floor here.

166
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,930
If I hold the bob here,
then it is 5 degrees.

167
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,380
This is 5 degrees.

168
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:07,560
And when I hold the bob here,
it is 10 degrees.

169
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,810
Timing is not easy.

170
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,410

171
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,620
The best way to do it is to
start the timing when the

172
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,280
pendulum comes to a stop.

173
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,920
That is rather well defined.

174
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,630
And then you let it
swing 10 times.

175
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:26,060
And then when it comes to
a stop, you stop it.

176
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,360
And it would help me if you
would count how many

177
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,550
oscillations we have made,
because then I don't have to

178
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,790
look at it.

179
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,740
All I have to do is when I come
close to 10, I have to

180
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,010
watch for the moment
of stopping, and

181
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,460
then I will end it.

182
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,845
So we'll do this first
at 5 degrees.

183
00:09:45,845 --> 00:09:53,820

184
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,770
I'm going to start it
when it comes here.

185
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:00,520

186
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,230
OK.

187
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,252
Now you count.

188
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:17,210
AUDIENCE: One, two,
three, four.

189
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,538
WALTER LEWIN: You're
doing very well.

190
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:21,870
AUDIENCE: Five.

191
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,648
WALTER LEWIN: You're going
to pass this course.

192
00:10:25,648 --> 00:10:45,205
AUDIENCE: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

193
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:55,630
[APPLAUSE]

194
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,640
WALTER LEWIN: 45.7.

195
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:05,240
So that becomes that T. That
means this whole equation now

196
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,100
has to be divided by 10.

197
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,940
And now you will see why I
measured 10 oscillations.

198
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:18,050
So T is going to be 4.57 plus
or minus 0.2 divided by 10.

199
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,870
That is, plus or minus
0.02 seconds.

200
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:26,440
And you see comfortably
within the prediction.

201
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,420
So maybe my reaction time
is a little better

202
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,430
than 2/10 of a second.

203
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:36,160
Don't count on it because you
haven't seen the rest yet.

204
00:11:36,160 --> 00:12:00,080
So now 10 degrees.

205
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,690
That moment is crucial.

206
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,110
That moment is crucial.

207
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,660
That's where you can lose 4/10
of a second, and then you look

208
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,494
like an idiot in front
of your students.

209
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:44,348
AUDIENCE: 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

210
00:12:44,348 --> 00:13:11,220
[APPLAUSE]

211
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,280
WALTER LEWIN: Now comes
the hardest part.

212
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,730
The hardest part is that we
have to change the mass of

213
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,980
this object.

214
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,500

215
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,940
And the way that I'm going
to do that is prominently

216
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,090
demonstrated on the
cover of my book.

217
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:33,110

218
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,135
Yes, I'm going to hang
on that pendulum.

219
00:13:36,135 --> 00:13:38,990

220
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,330
It is a difficult
demonstration.

221
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,990
First of all, it is painful.

222
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,600
It really is.

223
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,650
Second, the timing is tricky.

224
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:52,250
Because when you look at the
pendulum and when you see it

225
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,350
standstill, that is really
well defined plus

226
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,930
or minus 0.1 seconds.

227
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,300
When you're swinging yourself
however, then you can only do

228
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,850
it by sensing the moment that
you think you standstill.

229
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,460
And that's what I will do.

230
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,880
And then you will
do the counting.

231
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,400

232
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,010
And this is very unpleasant.

233
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,260
It is.

234
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:24,680

235
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,650
Oh, there's something else
I haven't told you.

236
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,510
If you're a good physicist, you
will say, if you're going

237
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:36,600
to sit on that bob, then
effectively you bring the mass

238
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,480
of the bob up.

239
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,560
And so the lengths of the
pendulum will shorten.

240
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,895
And so you get a
shorter period.

241
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:45,450

242
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,320
And I know that, too.

243
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,450
Therefore, I will have to
stretch my body so that when

244
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,600
it is here, that it is
almost completely

245
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,360
parallel to the floor.

246
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,150
If I don't do that, I will not
be able to convince you that

247
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,770
the period is independent
of the mass.

248
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,070
And that makes it very
difficult for me.

249
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:14,570

250
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,510
So I will start it
at some moment.

251
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,000
You will see when, and then
you do the counting.

252
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:36,540

253
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,186

00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,950
And in fact, nobody knows why.

263
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,701
Have to start all over.

264
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:15,190
[AUDIENCE CHATTERING]

265
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,300
WALTER LEWIN: I did
not stop it.

266
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,930
I really didn't.

267
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,180
Oh, it's still counting?

268
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,070

269
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,020
OK, I have enough energy to give
it one more attempt, but

270
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,360
not to give it two
more attempts.

271
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,610
OK.

272
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,980

273
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,800

45.9 plus or minus 0.2.

286
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:25,450
Period is 4.59 plus
or minus the 0.02.

287
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,358

[APPLAUSE]

289
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,640
WALTER LEWIN: If I have a tennis
ball in my hand and I

290
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,420
dropped the tennis ball from a
certain height, give it no

291
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:57,320
speed, and it will bounce back,
then it can never bounce

292
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,000
higher than where
it started from.

293
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,360
If it did, then we physicists
would say that is a gross

294
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,060
violation of the conservation
of energy.

295
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:12,260
And that is the holiest or
all laws in physics.

296
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,100
It cannot go higher.

297
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,240

298
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:24,100
Suppose the object has
a mass m and is a

299
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:31,116
distance h from the floor.

300
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:31,990
Here's the floor.

301
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,450
Here's the objects, h.

302
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,960
We associate with the position
of that object an energy that

303
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,800
has a name.

304
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,580
We call that potential energy.

305
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,750
And that potential
energy is m g h.

306
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,280
You already know what g is.

307
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,950
Well, h is this distance
in meters.

308
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:58,150
So when the object is here
on the floor, h is 0.

309
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,920
So there is no potential
energy.

310
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:07,350
As the object goes down, it
picks up speed and we

311
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,730
associate with speed energy,
which we call kinetic energy.

312
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,760
And the kinetic energy
of an object with

313
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:22,470
mass m is 1/2 mv squared.

314
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:27,954
m is the mass and v is the
speed of that object.

315
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:32,010
If the object goes down and it
hits the floor, then the

316
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,130
potential energy is 0.

317
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,436
And all that energy is now
converted to kinetic energy.

318
00:20:38,436 --> 00:20:42,770
Because energy, we believe,
is conserved.

319
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:47,720
Now, when it hits the floor,
some of that kinetic energy

320
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,540
may be converted into heat
because of the compression.

321
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,500
If it were a tennis ball, that
would certainly happen.

322
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,540
So in other words, when it
bounces back, the total energy

323
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,410
is no longer the full energy h,
but is a little less, and

324
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,750
so it won't bounce as high.

325
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,200
But there's no way that it could
come up higher than h.

326
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,740
Suppose it could come after
one bounce up here.

327
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,850
Well, that would solve the
world's energy problem.

328
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,000
Because you simply sit down and
you watch the ball game.

329
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,770
And there goes the ball higher,
and the second one it

330
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,830
goes again higher.

331
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,430
But if it goes the first time
higher, it will do that the

332
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,530
second time.

333
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,770
And so after an hour, that thing
is about a few thousands

334
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,390
meters in the sky.

335
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,060
And when it comes down on the
floor, it has an enormous

336
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,570
speed, great amount
of kinetic energy.

337
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,680
And so you got energy
out of nothing.

338
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,350
But there is no such thing in
physics as a free lunch, so

339
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,330
that's not going to happen.

340
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:53,950
So the object can never
go any higher than h.

341
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,110
And with a tennis ball, there
is also what we call the

342
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:01,420
dissipation of heat when
it hits the floor.

343
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:07,690
Now, the situation is difficult
with a pendulum

344
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,660
because a pendulum doesn't
hit the floor.

345
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,410
And so there is no heat
loss because it

346
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,350
doesn't hit the floor.

347
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,460
So if you bring a pendulum at
a certain distance above the

348
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,230
ground like this, and you let
it swing, when it comes back

349
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,455
here, it is almost exactly
at that same height.

350
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:30,650
It cannot be higher.

351
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,800
That would be a violation of
the conservation of energy.

352
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,950
But since the air drag
is so small,

353
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,210
there's almost no damping.

354
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,210
And in fact, when you saw the
demonstration I just did, you

355
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,320
may have noticed that you
really didn't see this.

356
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,120
It really kept going
and it kept going.

357
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,810
As long as you realize that if
I release it from a certain

358
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:58,930
location with 0 speed, it can
never, when it comes back, be

359
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:02,040
higher than that location.

360
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,960
This whole idea is behind
demolishing buildings.

361
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,340
With a building demolishing,
you take a huge mass.

362
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,310
You lift it up over
a distance h.

363
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,630
And then, you put your target,
which is your house, or

364
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,000
whatever it is, right at the
bottom when all these

365
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,820
potential energy is being
converted to kinetic energy.

366
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,100
And so this object is hit with
an enormous amount of energy,

367
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:35,120
at high speed, and you demolish,
thereby, the wall.

368
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,640
Here, we have a glass plate.

369
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,350
You better go out of the way
because this is a dangerous

370
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,920
experiment.

371
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,110
This is a glass wall.

372
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:51,750
So if I bring this object
exactly at that glass wall--

373
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:56,810
and if I'm clever enough to
let it go with 0 speed, it

374
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,000
could not break that glass.

375
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,590
But if my hands shake a little,
and if I gave it a

376
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:07,600
little push, then of course,
it can come back.

377
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,070
And it may want to go
higher than this.

378
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,320
And that would mean--

379
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,685

380
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:29,090
[LAUGHTER]

381
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,580
[APPLAUSE]

382
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,145
WALTER LEWIN: I know
you, guys.

383
00:24:34,145 --> 00:24:37,225
Students love it when
the glass breaks.

384
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,760

385
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,050
That's why they pay such
a high tuition at MIT.

386
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:51,398

387
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:59,762
[APPLAUSE]

388
00:24:59,762 --> 00:25:03,910
[LAUGHTER]

389
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,520
WALTER LEWIN: That's OK.

390
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,830
Just take that off.

391
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:14,320
Now comes an experiment, which
is emotionally the most

392
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,620
difficult for me of this
whole evening.

393
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,902
I'm going to put my life on the
line to show you that I am

394
00:25:23,902 --> 00:25:28,510
really a believer of the
conservation of energy.

395
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:33,450
And you will see how I'm
going to do that.

396
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,750
I'm going to take the
place of the glass.

397
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:44,060
And I'm going to hold this
object at my chin.

398
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,500
And I cannot move any
further back, so

399
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,920
there's no cheat here.

400
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,370
I'm going to release it right
from my chin here.

401
00:25:53,370 --> 00:26:02,310
You realize, as you have just
seen, that the slightest push

402
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,050
and this will be my
last lecture.

403
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:06,610

404
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,860
And no book signing
afterwards.

405
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:13,800

406
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,010
So I need your collaboration.

407
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:25,550
When I count down from 3 to
0, no noise, no coughing.

408
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,870
And I would even appreciate it,
if for those 3 seconds,

409
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,120
you would not even breathe.

410
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,640

411
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,910
And I have to tell
you something.

412
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:41,330
I couldn't sleep all night.

413
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,160
I'm going to close my eyes.

414
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,430
I don't want to see it.

415
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,600
And I'm going to count
down from 3 to 0.

416
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:54,020

417
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:58,100
3, 2, 1, 0.

418
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:03,992

419
00:27:03,992 --> 00:27:21,680
[APPLAUSE]

420
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,100
WALTER LEWIN: And normally,
after this demonstration, tell

421
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,215
the class physics works,
and I'm still alive.

422
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:30,930

423
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,100
And when an article was written
about me in The New

424
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,140
York Times a few years ago, on
the second page of The New

425
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,020
York Times is the wisdom
of the day.

426
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,350
And the wisdom of the day
was physics works,

427
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,188
and I'm still alive.

428
00:27:44,188 --> 00:27:58,660
[APPLAUSE]

429
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,560
WALTER LEWIN: White light, like
sunlight, is composed of

430
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,970
all the colors that you
see in the rainbow.

431
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:12,680
If I scatter white light off
very small particles, then the

432
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,190
blue light is scattered more
than the red light.

433
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,760
And we give that a name in
physics, we call that Rayleigh

434
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,880
scattering.

435
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,410
Rayleigh scattering only happens
when the particles of

436
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:28,740
which the white light scatters
is smaller than

437
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,370
a tenth of a micron.

438
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:34,710
That means a thousand times
smaller than the

439
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:37,120
thickness of your hair.

440
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,880
So it has to be a very,
very small.

441
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,800
If the particles are as large
as half a micron, then there

442
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,810
is no longer Rayleigh
scattering.

443
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,730
There is no [? preferred ?]
scattering for the blue light.

444
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:55,640
All colors scatter equally, and
so white light scattered

445
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,600
off particles at a
half a micron or

446
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,060
larger remains white.

447
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,660

448
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:08,700
The dependence of the power
of scattering--

449
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,390
so I'll give that
P, the power--

450
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:18,060
is proportional when we have
Rayleigh scattering.

451
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,450
This is the only equation that
may bother you, to 1 over

452
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,250
lambda to the fourth,
and lambda is the

453
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,800
wavelength of light.

454
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,100
And I will not bother you to
tell you what the wavelengths

455
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,670
of light is.

456
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,560
That may confuse you.

457
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:37,470
But I will tell you that blue
light has a wavelength which

458
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:42,510
is about 1.5 times lower
than red light.

459
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:46,230
And so if you take 1.5
to the power 4--

460
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,330
trust me.

461
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:50,690
Yeah, 1.5 to the power
4, you get 5.

462
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:54,840
And that means, in Rayleigh
scattering, blue light has a

463
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,960
five times higher probability
to scatter than red light.

464
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,850
And I'm going to demonstrate
that to you in two complete

465
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,150
different ways.

466
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:12,110
The first way that I'm going
to do that is to make it

467
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:16,520
completely dark in the lecture
hall and have light going

468
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,770
straight up here.

469
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,940

470
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:25,080
Then, I will light a cigarette,
and the smoke of a

471
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,410
cigarette has particles
that are smaller

472
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,750
than a 10th of a micron.

473
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:34,940
And so the light that you will
see that is scattered off the

474
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,490
smoke will be blue.

475
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,020
So you have seen, in front
of you own eyes, Rayleigh

476
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,780
scattering.

477
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:46,240
Because the red lights, more
or less, goes through.

478
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,470
It is really the blue that
dominates it, that has the

479
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,990
highest probability.

480
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:56,070
So we're first going to do that
demonstration to show you

481
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:00,300
Rayleigh scattering of
cigarette smoke.

482
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:04,040
And then I have a surprise for
you to also show you Mie

483
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,420
scattering.

484
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,550
But let's first do the Rayleigh
scattering with

485
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:10,670
cigarette smoke.

486
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:15,450
This is also not a pleasant
demonstration.

487
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:22,222
For those of you who think that
lecturing is easy, no.

488
00:31:22,222 --> 00:31:29,194
[LAUGHTER]

489
00:31:29,194 --> 00:31:32,182
[APPLAUSE]

490
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:43,140

491
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,390
WALTER LEWIN: OK.

492
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:55,390

493
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,950
I'm going to make it completely
dark, and then I'm

494
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,640
going to hold it in there.

495
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,510
All lights off.

496
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,752
All off.

497
00:32:03,752 --> 00:32:06,480
All off.

498
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,840
So we all agree that this
is white light,

499
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,290
which is coming up.

500
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:12,570
And you don't see the light here
because there is nothing

501
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,650
that scatters it in
your direction.

502
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,770
So you don't see light here.

503
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,970
But now look.

504
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,530
Those of you who see
blue say yeah.

505
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,360
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

506
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,153
WALTER LEWIN: Those of you who
do not see blue, say no.

507
00:32:28,153 --> 00:32:28,880
AUDIENCE: No.

508
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,130
WALTER LEWIN: You better
see an eye doctor.

509
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:36,380

510
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,540
Now comes the hardest part.

511
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,840
If I inhale the smoke and I
leave it in my lungs for a

512
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,110
minute, there is water
vapor in my lungs.

513
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:53,150
And this water vapor will
precipitate onto these very

514
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,810
small smoke particles.

515
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,210
And so the smoke particles
will grow.

516
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,700
They will become small
water drops, larger

517
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,990
than all 0.5 microns.

518
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:06,010
And that means if I hold it
one minute in my lungs and

519
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:10,590
puff it out, you will not see
blue light, but you will see

520
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,200
white light.

521
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,280
Because you're now in the Mie
scattering domain, all colors

522
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,750
scatters equally.

523
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:21,910
I will tell you that just before
I puff it out and you

524
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:27,790
will see the white smoke, I will
just before I do that, I

525
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,490
will remind you of the color
that you see now.

526
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,510
I will only do that
for a few seconds.

527
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:37,590
Then I will remove it and
I will empty my lungs.

528
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,840
Terrible demo.

529
00:33:38,840 --> 00:34:04,226

530
00:34:04,226 --> 00:34:22,739
[APPLAUSE]

531
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,139
WALTER LEWIN: Who saw
the white light?

532
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,310
Just say yes.

533
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,820
AUDIENCE: Yes.

534
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,324
WALTER LEWIN: If any one of you
has the courage to say so

535
00:34:31,324 --> 00:34:34,690
no, who did not see
white light?

536
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:35,940
AUDIENCE: No.

537
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,090

538
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:41,174
WALTER LEWIN: Thank you.

539
00:34:41,174 --> 00:34:49,040
[APPLAUSE]

540
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,487
WALTER LEWIN: And now I'm going
to explain to you-- in

541
00:34:55,487 --> 00:35:02,270
fact, you could probably guess
that why the sky is blue and

542
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,360
why clouds are white.

543
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:09,560
Clouds consist of very small
water drops, surely larger

544
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,420
than half a micron, which
is Mie scattering.

545
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:17,260
So the white light of the sun
scattered off the cloud--

546
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,000
white remains white.

547
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,950
So you now, for the first time
in your life, may have an

548
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,800
explanation why clouds
are white.

549
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,610

550
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:31,180
And you should, or may,
also understand now

551
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:34,390
why the sky is blue.

552
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,210

553
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:41,860
Here is the ground
and you are here.

554
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,460
And here is, say, roughly the
top of the atmosphere.

555
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,130
And the sunlight comes
in like this.

556
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:54,750
Sun is infinitely far away, so
the sun comes in like this.

557
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,290

558
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:04,450
The atmosphere is full of very
small dust particles, smaller

559
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,770
than a 10th of a micron.

560
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:10,260
And even the density
fluctuations of the air

561
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,740
molecules themselves are clearly
smaller than the 10th

562
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,020
of a micron.

563
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,520
And so you get ideal Rayleigh
scattering.

564
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,890
So white light comes in,
you're standing here.

565
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:25,040
But what is the light
that comes to you?

566
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,930
Predominantly blue.

567
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:29,170
So the sky is blue.

568
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:32,600
The light that is scattered
here, comes to you is

569
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,150
predominantly blue.

570
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,400
So that's why the sky is blue.

571
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,530
And so the reason is simply that
it is Rayleigh scattering

572
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,895
of the dust particles
in the atmosphere.

573
00:36:43,895 --> 00:36:47,610

574
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:53,970
If the sun is high in the sky,
the total amount of sunlight

575
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:58,050
that is scattered in your
direction is only 1%.

576
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,780
So it's very little.

577
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:04,410
If the sun is 5 degrees above
the horizon, then the sunlight

578
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:08,860
has to travel through a
lot more atmosphere.

579
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,520
And so I think here a situation
which is extreme,

580
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:16,000
when we have sunrise
or sunset.

581
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,660
So the sun is there and the
light comes from this side and

582
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,560
you are standing here.

583
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,810
This is not to scale.

584
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:26,400

585
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:33,020
This layer of atmosphere is now
so enormously large that

586
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:38,340
more than 99% of all the
sunlight on the way to you is

587
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,540
scattered away.

588
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,500
So what is scattered away?

589
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,580
The blue is gone.

590
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,160
But if you look at 1 over lambda
to the fourth, the

591
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,750
green is gone.

592
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,060
All colors are gone.

593
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,645
There's only one color which has
the largest wavelengths,

594
00:37:53,645 --> 00:37:56,590
which by the way, is
650 nanometers.

595
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:00,380
I wasn't supposed to tell
you, but I decided.

596
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:05,990
So the only light that makes
it through you is red.

597
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:11,030
And so that is the reason
why the sun looks red.

598
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:15,860
And there is a cloud here in the
sky, and that cloud sees

599
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:20,690
light where all the small
wavelengths have been

600
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,740
scattered out.

601
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:26,590
And so this side of the
cloud is also red.

602
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:30,070
You can now understand that the
more pollution there is in

603
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:34,740
the air, the more beautiful
sunsets are.

604
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:38,180
And it is well known that after
volcanic eruptions, the

605
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:43,860
sunsets and the sunrises
are truly fantastic.

606
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,730
It's also the moon that is
red when it comes up.

607
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,200
And even the stars
and the planets.

608
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,580
You may never have noticed
it because it's not an

609
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,430
overwhelming thing.

610
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:57,400
It is the sun that is the
overwhelming thing that makes

611
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,610
the entire sky red.

612
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:08,010
And so I have decided that I'm
going to create in 26-100, a

613
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:13,800
blue sky for you and a red
sunset, killing two

614
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,270
birds with one stone.

615
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,760
And for the physicists in my
audience, I'm going to kill

616
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,190
three birds with one stone.

617
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:25,630
But the third bird comes
a little later.

618
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,920
I have here a bucket which
is filled with sodium

619
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,570
thiosulfate--

620
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,520
in this bucket.

621
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,880
And when I turn the light on,
you will not even see any

622
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,540
light from that bucket.

623
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,205
Nothing is scattered
in your direction.

624
00:39:42,205 --> 00:39:45,090

625
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:48,900
I think of that as being
the sun, by the way.

626
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,710
Now I'm going to add a little
bit of sulfuric acid.

627
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:59,300
And when I do that, very small
sulfur particles, smaller than

628
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:05,030
the 10th of a micron, will
precipitate in that solution.

629
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,620
Rayleigh scattering.

630
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:11,860
And so the light that will
come to you is blue.

631
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:16,410
And you will see blue light,
just like with the smoke.

632
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:21,660
But now, as time goes on, we
will get more and more and

633
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:26,850
more and more of those
0.1 micron particles.

634
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:30,510
And so the light that
comes out here has

635
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,240
no blue in it anymore.

636
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,250
It doesn't have any green
in it anymore.

637
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:37,530
It's all scattered in your
direction, just like here with

638
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,050
the sunset.

639
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,405
So what color do you think
the sun is going to get?

640
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:42,520
AUDIENCE: Red.

641
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,030
WALTER LEWIN: It's
going to be red.

642
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:48,380
That's why I said I'm going to
kill two birds with one stone.

643
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:54,430
So I will add the
sulfuric acid.

644
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:57,370
The difficulty with this
experiment is always if you

645
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,810
put too much sulfuric acid
in it, the whole

646
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,910
process goes too fast.

647
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:05,170
And if you put too little
in it, then

648
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,890
you will become impatient.

649
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:09,670
At least, MIT students would.

650
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:14,350
So I'm going to put
this in and stir.

651
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:17,080
And then, make it immediately
dark.

652
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:22,150

653
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,590
And I want you to look at
the sky, which is--

654
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,440
here is the sky.

655
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,100
If you sit all the way there,
you don't see it so well.

656
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,140
But look, how much did
you pay for this?

657
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,390
These people have
a better view.

658
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:37,060

659
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,170
So just keep looking.

660
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:45,740
For me, it's already beginning
to turn a little bluish.

661
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,360
We'll just give it a little
bit more time.

662
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,420
The sun looks just white
light as it was before.

663
00:41:52,420 --> 00:42:00,990

664
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,310
I always have a backup
you see.

665
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:05,740
If this takes too long, then
what I do, I add another

666
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:16,200
teeny, weeny little bit of
sulfuric acid to speed up the

667
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,450
process a little.

668
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:25,470

669
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,530
I see blue light.

670
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:29,610
And when I look at the
sun, it looks a

671
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:32,780
little reddish already.

672
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,950
For the physicists among you,
light that scatters over an

673
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:41,670
angle of 90 degrees, this light
that scatters in this

674
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,450
direction--

675
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:45,520
the people who paid the most
tonight, who are sitting right

676
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,760
here, the light is also
linearly polarized.

677
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,090
That was also the case with the
smoke experiment, but I

678
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:55,390
didn't mention that.

679
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:58,330
But for those of you who are
sitting here, I can show you

680
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:02,080
with my polarimeter, when I
rotate my polarimeter, that I

681
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,040
can-- the blue sky
completely dark.

682
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,540
And the blue sky completely
bright again.

683
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,410
The people who are sitting
there, the angle of scattering

684
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:13,580
is not 90 degrees.

685
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,650
So they won't see it so well.

686
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,845
But you people see it very
well, don't you?

687
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,120
AUDIENCE: Yes.

688
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,410
WALTER LEWIN: 100% polarized.

689
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:29,930
[APPLAUSE]

690
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:33,070
WALTER LEWIN: Look
at that sun.

691
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:38,100
Let's face it, isn't this
incredibly romantic?

692
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:45,380
In 26-100, at the center of MIT,
you are seeing, in the

693
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:49,380
lecture hall, a red sunset.

694
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:57,780
And in fact, the sun is so red
now, that I think the sunset

695
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,804
is very close.

696
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:17,238
[APPLAUSE]

697
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:22,720

698
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,380
WALTER LEWIN: I have given,
in this lecture

699
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:30,290
hall, about 800 lectures.

700
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:39,270
And it is wonderful to be back
here, but it really hurts to

701
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:46,200
know that this is my last
lecture in 26-100.

702
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,830
I have, therefore, decided
that I want to

703
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:54,090
leave you in style.

704
00:44:54,090 --> 00:45:02,560
And the way I will do that is
to leave 26-100 in my own

705
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,090
private rocket.

706
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:08,374

707
00:45:08,374 --> 00:45:19,828
[APPLAUSE]

708
00:45:19,828 --> 00:45:38,752

709
00:45:38,752 --> 00:46:39,508
[APPLAUSE]

710
00:46:39,508 --> 00:46:41,500
WALTER LEWIN: Thank you.

711
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:54,448
[APPLAUSE]

712
00:46:54,448 --> 00:46:55,698
WALTER LEWIN: Thank you.

713
00:46:55,698 --> 00:46:57,620

714
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:04,210
So now we have about 15 minutes
left for questions.

715
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:06,470
And if you have a question,
raise your hand.

716
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:09,970
Then Claire will come to you
with the microphone.

717
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:13,780
And then, I hope we can
communicate that way.

718
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:17,700
You phrase the question and I
will try to give the answer.

719
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,790
So who wants to go first?

720
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,545
There's a person there.

721
00:47:21,545 --> 00:47:23,380
Yes, we see your hand here.

722
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,630
You'll come next.

723
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:27,830

724
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:29,960
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
a beautiful lecture.

725
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,160
I am tempted to ask
you what pi is.

726
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,810
WALTER LEWIN: It's not so easy
for me to understand you.

727
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,460
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
a beautiful lecture.

728
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,880
I'm tempted to ask
you what pi is.

729
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,850
But I think I'd better
ask instead--

730
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:45,750
WALTER LEWIN: Have you
ever gone to a

731
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,000
Thanksgivings dinner?

732
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,220

733
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:50,490
AUDIENCE: OK.

734
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,540
WALTER LEWIN: That
is what pie is.

735
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:56,480
AUDIENCE: Are you familiar with
the alleged phenomenon of

736
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,860
a green flash at sunset.

737
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,950
WALTER LEWIN: And the
answer is yes.

738
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:02,250
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
that, please?

739
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,410
WALTER LEWIN: I've seen
it many times.

740
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:07,770
The explanation is not as
simple as you may think.

741
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:08,680
I would suggest--

742
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,040
and I mean that seriously.

743
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,410
Since a short answer is not
possible, that you look it up

744
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:14,840
on the web.

745
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,720
It's well described.

746
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,670
I have seen it many times in
Austria in the mountains.

747
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:23,680
That, indeed, the last fraction
of setting of the

748
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:28,790
sun, that you may, but not
always, see a green flash.

749
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:30,930
And if you ever want
to see it, you have

750
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:32,730
to be with two people.

751
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:36,890
One person has to be standing
next to you and you should not

752
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:38,460
look at the sun.

753
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,650
Because if you look at the
sun, even though there's

754
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:47,290
almost no sunlight left, your
retina is still too

755
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:48,740
overexposed.

756
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,320
And so the person next to you,
when you look like this,

757
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,910
should say, look now.

758
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:58,576
And then you look, and
that's the way it is.

759
00:48:58,576 --> 00:49:07,740
[APPLAUSE]

760
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,890
WALTER LEWIN: There's a
question right here.

761
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:10,680
Why don't we take that first?

762
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,560
And then, there's a
woman over there.

763
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,816
And this gentleman also.

764
00:49:14,816 --> 00:49:17,215
AUDIENCE: Well, I just wanted to
thank you for the lecture.

765
00:49:17,215 --> 00:49:24,550
AUDIENCE: As a youngster, I read
a book which told me to

766
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:27,160
stare at the sun, then
I can change things

767
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,900
by staring at things.

768
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,100
Now what I did was I used to
stare at sun at sunset.

769
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,470
WALTER LEWIN: You stare
at the sun?

770
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:35,100
AUDIENCE: At sunset.

771
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,470
WALTER LEWIN: At sunset.

772
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:38,120
Not a very good idea.

773
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,080
You have to be very careful.

774
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,480
AUDIENCE: I found out
the hard way.

775
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,790
WALTER LEWIN: And so you damaged
your eyes and you

776
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,040
asked for it.

777
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,300

778
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:50,660
AUDIENCE: But the key thing
was that after that, I was

779
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,790
supposed to stare at a white
wall, which I did.

780
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:55,360
But what I saw a red--

781
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,645
WALTER LEWIN: I know exactly
what you saw.

782
00:49:56,645 --> 00:49:58,090
AUDIENCE: A red spot moving
around wherever--

783
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:01,350
WALTER LEWIN: Probably the spot
was not red, but green.

784
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,510
It's a well-known phenomenon.

785
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:07,490
So you have, indeed, done
something to your retina and

786
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:11,750
the message that is sent to you
brains then tell you the

787
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,140
green aftereffect.

788
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,920
It's very well-known effect.

789
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,220
You don't even have to
look to the sun.

790
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,810
You can even do it with a light
like that and stare in

791
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,400
that light for some time.

792
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,290
And then, all of a sudden look
at the white wall and you see

793
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:25,490
a different color.

794
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,150
It's a very interesting thing.

795
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,550
And physics cannot
explain that.

796
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:32,690
But you see, this
is neurology.

797
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:35,818
And so it's not our
responsibility to explain it.

798
00:50:35,818 --> 00:50:43,310
[APPLAUSE]

799
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:45,480
AUDIENCE: So this is, I guess,
a more personal--

800
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,710
WALTER LEWIN: Speak as loud as
you can because I have a

801
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,730
hearing disability.

802
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:49,100
AUDIENCE: This is a more
personal question.

803
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:52,000
I was just wondering, what
inspired you to become such a

804
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,910
great professor?

805
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:53,500
WALTER LEWIN: Why is what?

806
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,170
AUDIENCE: What inspired you to
become a professor, and a

807
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:57,040
great one at that?

808
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:57,500
WALTER LEWIN: Can
you translate?

809
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:57,800
I can't hear.

810
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,385
AUDIENCE: What inspired you?

811
00:50:59,385 --> 00:51:00,235
WALTER LEWIN: Why is what?

812
00:51:00,235 --> 00:51:02,910
AUDIENCE: What inspired you
to become a professor?

813
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:04,870
WALTER LEWIN: Oh,
that was luck.

814
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:08,300

815
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:12,460
I had my training in
nuclear physics.

816
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:17,880
And then, I had some offers for
one year post-doc to the

817
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,820
United States.

818
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:26,110
And for reasons that are not so
clear, I picked MIT because

819
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:29,840
a whole new field was born
here in Cambridge,

820
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,180
Massachusetts, initiated
by Professor Bruno

821
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,740
Rossi who was at MIT.

822
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:39,650
Executed beautifully by
Riccardo Giacconi who

823
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:43,002
received, not too long ago,
the Nobel Prize for that.

824
00:51:43,002 --> 00:51:46,260
That was the discovery
of x-ray astronomy.

825
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:50,050
And even though I knew nothing
about astronomy at the time, I

826
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:52,340
decided it was time
to change fields.

827
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,270
So I accepted the
offer at MIT.

828
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:58,720
And then, for reasons that are
still unclear to me, but

829
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,920
George Clarke, who is in the
audience, knows probably why

830
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,160
they offered me a
professorship.

831
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,410
And I never left.

832
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:09,210

833
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,460
Does that answer
your question?

834
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:15,780

835
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,090
Yeah, you need the
microphone here.

836
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:21,350

837
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,190
We have 10 more minutes,
so we can

838
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:25,580
handle quite a few questions.

839
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,900
AUDIENCE: So I sat in on your
lectures, here I think about

840
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,890
20 years ago.

841
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:34,340
And I had forgotten that one
thing that I learned from you

842
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:37,634
was how to draw dotted
lines on chalkboards.

843
00:52:37,634 --> 00:52:44,280
[APPLAUSE]

844
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,540
AUDIENCE: Which I actually
used myself when I was a

845
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,620
professor for some
number of years.

846
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:51,570
So very useful skill.

847
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:53,020
But here's what I'd
like to ask you.

848
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,960
I'd like to ask you, when you
started teaching physics, and

849
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,940
how your lectures evolved
over time?

850
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,450
WALTER LEWIN: What was
the last question?

851
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:06,340
AUDIENCE: How did your lectures
evolve over time?

852
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,142
WALTER LEWIN: Didn't get it.

853
00:53:08,142 --> 00:53:12,110
AUDIENCE: How did your lectures
evolve over time?

854
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:13,360
WALTER LEWIN: Yeah.

855
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:20,280

856
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,635
I think I was always
eccentric.

857
00:53:21,635 --> 00:53:24,600

858
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,670
It's true.

859
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:30,780
And so from day one,
my lectures were

860
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,740
different from the mean.

861
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:40,190
But of course, they evolved in a
way that grew substantially.

862
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:42,760
And that is not because of the
dotting of the line, because I

863
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,420
could already do that
in high school.

864
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:49,180

865
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:53,140
Today, there are hundreds of my
lectures that can be viewed

866
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,398
on the web.

867
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,130
Two complete courses--

868
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:00,010
the first course for freshman,
the second course Electricity

869
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:01,080
and Magnetism.

870
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,370
And the first course
for sophomores,

871
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:06,320
Vibrations and Waves.

872
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:10,470
They are now being viewed daily,
on average, by 6,000

873
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:15,110
people all over the world, which
is 2 million per year.

874
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:18,110
And so every morning when I wake
up and during the day,

875
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:21,040
about two dozen questions
come to me by email from

876
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,020
all over the world.

877
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:28,340
Many ask questions and I answer
every single email.

878
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:32,690
But it is amazing that many
physics professors want to

879
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:36,066
know how I make those
dotted lines.

880
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:48,520
[APPLAUSE]

881
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:54,560
WALTER LEWIN: There is a
two-minute videotape, which

882
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,260
someone made.

883
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:59,910
Someone looked at all the dotted
lines that I ever drew

884
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:03,100
in 801 and put that
in one videotape.

885
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,770

886
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:08,380
It's a riot.

887
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,630
You see [MAKING SOUNDS].

888
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:12,560

889
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:18,780
[APPLAUSE]

890
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:23,980
OK, we have time for a
few more questions.

891
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:25,620
Yep, Ana.

892
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,920
Ana, please use the microphone,
although I'm so

893
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,420
close to you that I can probably
understand you.

894
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,040
Ana is my Facebook friend.

895
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:38,640
I have an art quiz on Facebook
twice a week, and then my

896
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,740
Facebook friends who can answer
the question are always

897
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:45,260
mentioned every day that they
have the answer right.

898
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,740
Ana is at or near the top.

899
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,930
She almost always
has it right.

900
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,130
And she sometimes writes me
email and it just says,

901
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:55,270
Walter, I've worked eight
hours on this one.

902
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:56,665
I really have to give up.

903
00:55:56,665 --> 00:55:58,420
I don't have more time.

904
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,230
Go ahead.

905
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,510
AUDIENCE: What is your favorite
lecture of all the

906
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:03,470
lectures that you've given?

907
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:04,856
WALTER LEWIN: I don't
have a favorite one.

908
00:56:04,856 --> 00:56:05,808
No.

909
00:56:05,808 --> 00:56:07,240
I really don't.

910
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,570
I love all the subjects--

911
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:10,493
801, 802, 803.

912
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:12,790
I really cannot say
I have a favorite.

913
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,590
If you ask me my favorite
artist, we

914
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:16,920
can talk about that.

915
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,305
But we do that on Facebook.

916
00:56:18,305 --> 00:56:23,640

917
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,850
There's a question here
and there's one there.

918
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:27,920
We have still five minutes
for questions.

919
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:35,250

920
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:38,922
Clair, who has the microphone?

921
00:56:38,922 --> 00:56:39,380
AUDIENCE: Hello?

922
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,350
Do I need to turn this on?

923
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:41,316
AUDIENCE: It's on.

924
00:56:41,316 --> 00:56:42,820
AUDIENCE: It's on?

925
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:45,835
I'm wondering how rainbows
relate to ray scattering.

926
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:46,740
Do they?

927
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,480
WALTER LEWIN: How
rainbows what?

928
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,840
AUDIENCE: Do rainbows have
anything to do with ray

929
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,770
scattering?

930
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:53,840
And also, why are they round?

931
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,530

932
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:57,310
WALTER LEWIN: Buy my book.

933
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:59,049
It's explained in my book.

934
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:13,520
[LAUGHTER]

935
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,850
AUDIENCE: Hi.

936
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:16,810
How do you prepare
your lectures?

937
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:21,460
How many time do you
take to prepare?

938
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,810
WALTER LEWIN: It's a
very good question.

939
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:27,100
And if I tell you how I
prepare them, then my

940
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:31,220
colleagues at MIT are
going to hate me.

941
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:34,220
On average, the preparation
for one lecture is

942
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:37,110
about 40 to 60 hours.

943
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:41,140
I dry run the lecture in
an empty classroom with

944
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,490
everything on the blackboard
that I am going to write on

945
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:47,110
the blackboard, pretending that
there is a full class in

946
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:49,640
front of me, but there
is no one.

947
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,420
And I talk to them as
if there is one.

948
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:54,710
I do that two weeks before
the lecture.

949
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:58,100
In general, the lecture is then
a little bit too long.

950
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,920
So I have to do some surgery.

951
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,390
Then one week before the
lecture, I dry run again.

952
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:06,020
Then I'm very close
to the time.

953
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:10,190
And then 5:00 AM of the morning
of the lecture--

954
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:11,740
you can ask my wife--

955
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:15,910
I am at MIT and I give the same
lecture dry run for an

956
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:19,970
empty classroom at 5:30 in the
morning when the lecture is at

957
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:23,400
10:00 and the same lecture
is at 11:00.

958
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,040
That's the way I prepare.

959
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,772
Don't tell my colleagues,
they will hate me.

960
00:58:28,772 --> 00:58:39,230
[APPLAUSE]

961
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:40,560
WALTER LEWIN: By the
way, I made an

962
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,310
exception for this lecture.

963
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,245
I dry run this lecture
six times.

964
00:58:44,245 --> 00:58:47,450

965
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:48,700
Yeah?

966
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,910

967
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:52,040
AUDIENCE: Hi.

968
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,230
What advice do you have
for a student

969
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,740
wanting to become a physicist?

970
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,505
WALTER LEWIN: What
do you have what?

971
00:58:56,505 --> 00:58:58,440
AUDIENCE: What advice do you
have for students who want to

972
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,990
be a physicist?

973
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:00,510
WALTER LEWIN: You
have to love it.

974
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:03,895
And if you don't love
it, don't touch it.

975
00:59:03,895 --> 00:59:06,590
And if you hate it,
it is because you

976
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:09,520
had a very bad teacher.

977
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,260
I make every student--

978
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,830
and not only at MIT, but
all over the world--

979
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:17,220
I make them love physics you.

980
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,240
You can read that in my book.

981
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,953
You should buy it.

982
00:59:19,953 --> 00:59:25,215
[APPLAUSE]

983
00:59:25,215 --> 00:59:26,490
WALTER LEWIN: One
more question.

984
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:30,070

985
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,455
OK, one more question.

986
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,705
Yeah, this gentleman here.

987
00:59:32,705 --> 00:59:36,580

988
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:40,550
AUDIENCE: What do you do for
fun, besides give lectures?

989
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:41,080
WALTER LEWIN: Arts.

990
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,125
Art history.

991
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:43,320
It's my love.

992
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,300
Physics is my life, art
history is my love.

993
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,170
Thank you.

994
00:59:49,170 --> 01:00:08,850
[APPLAUSE]

995
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:12,344
WALTER LEWIN: So the book
signing will start.

996
01:00:12,344 --> 01:00:17,160
You can buy books in the hall
and you can come down.

997
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,280
Now, I have one request.

998
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,720
Put in the book a piece of paper
and write down with very

999
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,630
clear letters to whom
I address that book.

1000
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:31,480
So if it is for your daughter
and her daughter is Emily, you

1001
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:36,400
write "For Emily." Even though
your name will be Peter, I

1002
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,690
will write in the book
"For Emily" and

1003
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:40,100
signed Walter Lewin.

1004
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,420
If you don't put in a
piece of paper, it's

1005
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,220
going to take so long.

1006
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:48,015
A few days ago, I had a book
signing and I didn't ask them

1007
01:00:48,015 --> 01:00:48,900
for a piece of paper.

1008
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,780
So here comes someone from
Turkey to me and I said, what

1009
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:53,350
is your name?

1010
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:55,100
He said, my name is
[? Atittta. ?]

1011
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,520
And then I said, how
do you spell that?

1012
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,770
He says, oh, that's very easy.

1013
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:01,590
It's [? A-T-I-T-T-T-A. ?]

1014
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:04,530
And then I said, well, it would
be better wouldn't it,

1015
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:06,310
if you write it on
a piece of paper.

1016
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:09,230
And I couldn't even read it.

1017
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:14,130
So please, write very carefully
the name to whom I

1018
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:15,420
should address the book.

1019
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:20,300

1020
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,550
We need a table.

1021
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:25,122
